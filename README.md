tl;dr `./gradlew run`

## Requirements
This project uses the [Gradle build tool](https://gradle.org/) and therefore relies on the installation of a [compatible Java version (8-19)](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html#compatibility) for running Gradle itself.

Furthermore the [Java toolchains feature of Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html) is used so that the intended Java version/distribution for the project is downloaded automatically and doesn't require any manual intervention by the user.

## Running
Just execute the following command to start the program: `./gradlew run`
